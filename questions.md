### What are components?
* A component controls a patch of screen called a view.
### What is Directive?
* A directive is a component, but it does not have template.
* Two type of directive: Structural and Attribute directives
* Structural directives alter layout by adding, removing, and replacing elements in DOM. e.g. *ngIf, *ngFor, *ngSwitch
* Attribute directives alter the appearance or behavior of an existing element.
